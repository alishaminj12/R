# Data Visualization with ggplot2: Penguins Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the **ggplot2** package in R for data visualization. The focus is on creating scatterplots to visualize the relationship between flipper length and body mass in penguins from the **Palmer Penguins** dataset.

## Project Setup

### Install Packages:

install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")

### Explanation:
- **`install.packages("ggplot2")`**: Installs the **ggplot2** package, which is essential for creating plots in R. This package provides a powerful system for producing complex and customizable graphics based on the grammar of graphics.

- **`install.packages("palmerpenguins")`**: Installs the **palmerpenguins** package, which contains the **Palmer Penguins** dataset that we will use for our analysis. This dataset includes size measurements for three species of penguins found in the Palmer Archipelago, providing a rich source of data for visualization and exploration.

### Load Libraries:

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

### Explanation:
- **`library(ggplot2)`**: Loads the **ggplot2** package into your R session, making its functions available for use.
- **`library(palmerpenguins)`**: Loads the **palmerpenguins** package to access the dataset.

### Data Used
The project uses the **Palmer Penguins** dataset (penguins), which contains size measurements for three penguin species: **Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo**. The dataset includes variables like:

- Flipper Length (mm)
- Body Mass (g)
- Species

data(penguins)
View(penguins)

### Explanation:
- **`data(penguins)`**: Loads the penguins dataset into your R session.
- **`View(penguins)`**: Opens a viewer to inspect the dataset visually.
